# Contributing to devopsdays-theme

The technical details on how to set up your local development environment for making changes to the `devopsdays-theme` [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme for the [Devopsdays](http://www.devopsdays.org/) website.

## Dev Setup

Working with a Hugo theme outside of a content-based repo has a few challenges. The `devopsdays-theme` repo contains a directory called `exampleSite`, which is what is used for testing theme development. The `config.toml` for the `exampleSite` contains the following value:

```
themesdir = "../.."
```

This tells Hugo where to look for its theme directories. This requires Hugo 0.18 or later.

You will need to run your watch command from the `exampleSite` directory; use something like this:

```
hugo server -w --baseUrl="http://localhost:1313"
```

NOTE: If you also load the existing `devopsdays-web` project, it is highly suggested that you use the `-p` flag on `hugo server` to load this theme on a different port. This will prevent your browser from caching assets like stylesheets, etc, from the other instance.


## Workflow

Our workflow is inspired by [Ian Bickering's guide to using GitHub Issues](http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2014/03/use-github-issues-to-organize-a-project.html).

### Milestones

**Stuff we are doing right now:** this is the “main” milestone. We give it a minor SemVer name (like 1.2 or 2.3). We create a new milestone when we have released a new minor version.

**Stuff we’ll probably do soon:** this is the standing [“Next Tasks” milestone](https://github.com/devopsdays/devopsdays-theme/milestone/3). We never change or rename this milestone.

**Stuff we probably won’t do soon:** this is the standing [“Blue Sky” milestone](https://github.com/devopsdays/devopsdays-theme/milestone/4). We refer to these tickets and sometimes look through them, but they are easy to ignore, somewhat intentionally ignored.

**What aren’t we sure about?:** issues with no milestone.

We use the permanent “Next Tasks” milestone (as opposed to renaming it to “Alpha 3” or actual-next-iteration milestone) because we don’t want to presume or default to including something in the real next iteration. When we’re ready to start planning the next iteration we’ll create a new milestone, and only deliberately move things into that milestone.

### Issues

All changes should be driven by issues (this is because our changelog generator is issue-driven). So before you implement a bugfix or an enhancement, you should make sure an issue has been created and properly tagged. These are the issue labels that really matter:

**Bug:** Something is broken in the theme and needs fixing.

**Enhancement:** Adding new functionality to the theme.

TODO: list the other label types and how they are used by github_changelog_generator

#### Collection of issues

Sometimes we have a collection of work that has to go together. This could be a release checklist, or perhaps a more complicated feature. In this case, create a "master" issue which links in its description to the sub-issues. We like to use the [checklist feature](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments) of GH issues for this; checking them off as the issues are closed.

### Pull Requests

Please submit your proposed changes as a Pull Request against this repository. If the PR will resolve an issue, please add `Fixes #123` to the PR.

## Releasing

To cut a new release, a tag must be created. This will trigger Travis to deploy a new release. Follow these steps:

1. Update the `theme_version` key in `theme.toml` to the new version.
1. Make sure you have the [`github_changelog_generator`](https://github.com/skywinder/github-changelog-generator) gem installed on your system.
1. Inside the repository, run `github_changelog_generator --future-release "x.x.x`.
1. Run `git add CHANGELOG.md`
1. Add the appropriate tag to the latest commit. The tags are named by the SemVer version number of the theme, with only numbers (that is, `1.1.31` vs `v1.1.31`)
1. Push to `origin master`, including tags (if you don't know how to do this, ask!)
